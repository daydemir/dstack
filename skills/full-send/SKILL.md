# Full Send

If the user triggered this, it's because they are not watching this thread, and
they want you to complete the work end-to-end autonomously. Your updates and
your final message go unread until long after you stop. You own the work from
its current state to a merged PR.

If the user did not explicitly request "full send" in some clear way, do not
assume full autonomy. If they did, everything below applies.

## Authority

The fleet contract and the user's existing task scope govern permissions and
delivery. Full Send is an explicit request to complete this task through a
verified merge and retirement of its task worktree. It does not grant access to
other accounts or machines, credential transfers, protected data, production
changes, destructive actions or human-only consent steps.

Use the test methods already authorized for the task. Keep repository commands,
fixtures, review gates and approval requirements. Resolve a genuine missing
permission through the harness's question tool while continuing independent
work; a workflow name does not override those boundaries. This task's own PR branch may be rebased and pushed with
`--force-with-lease` tied to its observed remote head; other branches retain
their existing authorization requirements.

## Steps

1. **Finish the change.** Complete the goal from the user's request with the
   smallest change that works. Fix the case that happened, not every case
   that could. If you are on the default branch, create a branch first. If
   the change needs the fleet's plan review, get it before writing code.
2. **Prove it.** Get proof for every change you made. See "Proof".
3. **Get feedback.** Use the `sol-loop` skill to verify changes.
4. **File the PR** with the `file-pr` skill. Rebase onto the latest default
   branch first. Add one short line to the description that says how you proved
   the change.
5. **Babysit the PR** with the `babysit-pr` skill. Fix real findings and CI
   failures. Get proof for each fix before you push it.
6. **Merge** when the merge gate passes.
7. **Retire the task worktree** through T3 or plain Git after verifying the
   default branch, then **report** in your final message: the PR link, the merge commit, your proof,
   and each decision you made for the user.

Stay active from step 1 to step 7. If you end your turn while checks or bots are
pending, the work stops, because nobody will prompt you again. Wait with the
watcher from `babysit-pr`, so something wakes you when the PR changes. In T3
Code that is `watch_pull_request`. If you stop before the merge, call
`unwatch_pull_request` first.

## Proof

Proof is evidence you observed yourself in this session: command output, a
reproduction, a screenshot. Use the most direct proof the change allows:

- Reproduce the original failure, apply the fix, then watch the same
  reproduction pass.
- Run the checks that the repo's CI runs (typecheck, lint, tests).
- Add one focused test that fails without the fix, when the behavior has none
  and the repo has a test setup.
- For UI and runtime behavior, run the app and look at the change. Green mocked
  tests do not prove that the user experience works. Attach screenshots to the
  PR when they help and you have a way to upload them.

When you cannot find a way to prove a change, you do not have full confidence.
Ask the user.

## Merge gate

Full confidence means all of these are true on the latest commit:

- Your proof covers every change in the diff.
- Required checks are green.
- Review bots have finished, and each finding is fixed or dismissed with a
  written reason.
- No human review still requests changes.
- The branch is up to date with the default branch, and GitHub reports it as
  mergeable.

Merge with the method the repo uses. Check the allowed methods and recent merged
PRs. If the repo uses a merge queue or auto-merge, stay until GitHub reports the
PR as merged. Merge through branch protection as configured. Never use `--admin`
or other bypasses. A required human review remains a gate; confidence or an
automated review does not replace it.

## Asking the user

A question in a normal message goes unseen, and the thread looks done. To ask
the user something, use the harness's question tool so the thread shows that
it is waiting: `AskUserQuestion` in Claude Code, `request_user_input_async` in Codex when available,
or the question tool your harness has. Put all the context in the question:
the PR link, what blocks you, and the options with your recommendation first.

Ask only when you cannot continue alone:

- You cannot prove the change.
- The merge gate cannot pass, and you cannot fix that yourself.
- The next step is outside the grant above: deleting data, touching production,
  changing things outside the repo, closing a PR, or force-pushing any other
  branch.
- The goal is ambiguous in a way that changes the result.
- Another PR makes this one obsolete.

Decide everything else yourself with sensible defaults, and list those decisions
in the report.

If no question tool is available, or the tool returns no answer, take the safe
path: leave the PR open and unmerged, and start your final message with the
question.
